## About me

- I like to think of myself as a rare instance of a software engineer with
strong soft/interpersonal skills.
- I love learning new things and facing new challenges, the most interesting
tasks are the hardest ones.
- If something will give me the opportunity to
work with things I am not familiar with, chances are that I'll have fun doing it.
- While I'm primarily a backend developer, I am also interested in things
related to AI and ML, and I've learned quite
- a bit from the field during
my studies. This means that while I may not be an AI/ML engineer, I know
- enough to effectively communicate and work with people
specializing in AI/ML.
- I always strive to write the best software that I can, both when it comes to
code style and quality,
- and when it comes to the design quality and consistency of larger software units.
- I love to work with teams of experienced engineers who share my passion
for quality software, but I believe that I am also
- very self-sufficient and independent in solving my tasks.
- I am a strong proponent of frequent and in-depth code review, as well as
pair programming - I believe that they are not only
- the best ways of writing quality code, but also a great means of personal improvement
for individual developers.
- I am passionate about open-source software, and I sometimes contribute
when time allows (although not nearly as often as I'd like).
